# Detailed Report: Azure Spotify ML Pipeline and Data Warehousing Project

## **Overview**

This project involves building a robust end-to-end data pipeline to process Spotify track data from 2017-2021, which includes the top 200 tracks across all regions, and store it in a Synapse Data Warehouse for analytics and predictive modeling of track popularity. This pipeline integrates several Azure services, including Blob Storage, Databricks, Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, Synapse Notebooks, and Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML), as well as orchestration tools like Apache Airflow. The purpose is to automate workflows, manage large-scale data processing, and generate actionable insights. Power BI is utilized for business intelligence and reporting, with Databricks notebooks executed using batch processing orchestrated by Data Factory.

## **Pipeline Architecture**

### **1. Data Ingestion**

- **Source**: Spotify dataset retrieved from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.**Aiflow** was used to orchestrate the data from kaggle to Blob Storage
- **Objective**: Extract raw track data containing attributes such as track names, artists, features (danceability, energy, tempo, etc.), and popularity.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Kaggle API Integration**:
     - Kaggle API is used to download the dataset.
     - Python libraries `kagglehub` and `requests` are employed for automation.
     ```python
     import kagglehub
     #Download latest version
     path = kagglehub.dataset_download("dhruvildave/spotify-charts")
     print("Path to dataset files:", path)
     ```
     This is block of code is used as one of the task in the python dag file , which was stored in the airflow dag folder. 
      Used wsl
  2. **Upload to Blob Storage via Airflow**:
     - Apache Airflow orchestrates the automation due to its strengths in workflow automation, such as scheduling, monitoring, and managing complex data pipelines. It was specifically chosen for its compatibility with WSL for Windows users, allowing seamless execution in a Windows environment, and its ease of integration with Azure services for handling large-scale data workflows.
     - The raw dataset is uploaded to an Azure Blob Storage container named `rawdata`. This step ensures centralized and scalable storage for subsequent processing.
  Here is the more refined guideline to establish this connection
Here's a step-by-step tutorial to set up and run an Airflow DAG for transferring Spotify data from Kaggle to Azure Storage:

## 1. Initial Setup

**Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
If your using windows operating system, install the wsl command for bash scripting ans ubutnu setup
once done , run the following commands
```bash
python -m venv airflow_env
source airflow_env/bin/activate
go to nano/airflow_env/bin/activate file, 
then 
add your azure storage credentials
export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="your_account_name"
export AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME="your_container"
export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="your_storage_connection_string"

```

**Install Required Packages**
```bash
pip install apache-airflow
pip install kagglehub
```

## 2. Initialize Airflow

**Set Up Airflow Home**
```bash
mkdir -p /home/shushilgirish/airflow/dags
cd airflow/dags
```

## 3. Configure Airflow

**Edit Airflow Configuration**
```bash
nano airflow.cfg
```
Key configurations to modify:
- Set the correct dags_folder path
- Configure the database connection
- Set the appropriate timezone

## 4. Start Airflow Services

**Start Webserver**
```bash
airflow webserver --port 8081
```
<img width="1273" alt="Airflow_webserver" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/444be708-92f0-4de4-a09d-44789d762275" />

**Start Scheduler in a New Terminal**
```bash
source airflow_env/bin/activate
airflow scheduler
```

## 5. Create Admin User
```bash
airflow users create \
    --username admin \
    --firstname Peter \
    --lastname Parker \
    --role Admin \
    --email spiderman@superhero.org
```

## 6. Verify Setup

**Check Running DAGs**
```bash
airflow dags list
```

**Check for Import Errors**
```bash
airflow dags list-import-errors
```

## 7. DAG Management

**View DAG Details**
```bash
airflow dags detail spotify_dagfile.py
```

## 8. Troubleshooting

**Check Port Conflicts**
```bash
lsof -i tcp:8080
```

**Stop Running Processes**
```bash
# Kill specific processes
kill 20003 44800 44801

# Kill scheduler using PID file
kill $(cat ~/airflow/airflow-scheduler.pid)
```

This setup allows you to create a DAG that:
- Fetches Spotify data from Kaggle
- Processes the data as needed
- Uploads it to Azure Storage Account
- Runs on a scheduled basis

Remember to configure the appropriate connections in Airflow for both Kaggle and Azure Storage authentication.

### **2. Data Storage in Azure Blob**

- **Azure Blob Storage**:
  - Acts as the central repository for raw and processed data.
  - Containers:
    - `rawdata`: Stores the raw Kaggle dataset.
    - `cleandata`: Stores the cleansed and transformed data.
  - Airflow triggers scripts to process the dataset and write cleansed data back to the `cleandata` container.

### **3. Data Transformation**

- **Platform**: Azure Databricks
- **Objective**: Cleanse and transform raw data by addressing missing values, normalizing features (e.g., tempo, loudness), and creating new interaction features such as `energy_tempo`. Write the processed data back to Blob Storage in Delta format for efficient querying and analysis.

#### **Steps**:

1. **Data Processing in Databricks**:
   - Raw data is loaded into a Databricks notebook.
   - Transformation steps include:
     - Handling missing values.
     - Normalizing numerical features (e.g., tempo, loudness).
     - Creating interaction features (e.g., energy \* tempo).
     ```python
     df["energy_tempo"] = df["energy"] * df["tempo"]
     ```
2. **Output**:
   - Transformed data is saved in **Delta format** in the `cleandata` container on Azure Blob Storage.
   ```python
   df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save(output_path)
   ```

   - The Delta files from Blob Storage are ingested into Synapse using external tables and pipelines.

2. **Data Model**:

   - Tables:
     - **Staging Table**: Holds the cleansed data.
     - **Fact Table**: Tracks metrics like popularity.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE staging_tracks AS
   SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(
     BULK 'https://shushilgstorage.blob.core.windows.net/cleandata/*.delta',
     FORMAT = 'DELTA'
   )
   ```

3. **Spark Notebooks for Analytics**:

   - Synapse Spark pools are used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
   - Analytical queries identify trends in track popularity based on attributes like region, tempo, and valence.

   - Features include `energy`, `tempo`, `valence`, and engineered features like `energy_tempo`.

2. **Model Building**:

   - Train a `RandomForestRegressor` model:
     ```python
     from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
     model = RandomForestRegressor()
     model.fit(X_train, y_train)
     ```
   - Evaluate the model using RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

3. **Deployment**:

   - Register the model in Azure ML for deployment.

   ```python
   from azureml.core.model import Model
   model = Model.register(workspace=ws, model_path="outputs/model.pkl", model_name="spotify_popularity_model")
