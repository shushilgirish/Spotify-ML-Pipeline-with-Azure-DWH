# Detailed Report: Azure Spotify ML Pipeline and Data Warehousing Project

## **Overview**

This project involves building a robust end-to-end data pipeline to process Spotify track data from 2017-2021, which includes the top 200 tracks across all regions, and store it in a Synapse Data Warehouse for analytics and predictive modeling of track popularity. This pipeline integrates several Azure services, including Blob Storage, Databricks, Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, Synapse Notebooks, and Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML), as well as orchestration tools like Apache Airflow. The purpose is to automate workflows, manage large-scale data processing, and generate actionable insights. Power BI is utilized for business intelligence and reporting, with Databricks notebooks executed using batch processing orchestrated by Data Factory.

## **Pipeline Architecture**

### **1. Data Ingestion**

- **Source**: Spotify dataset retrieved from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
- **Objective**: Extract raw track data containing attributes such as track names, artists, features (danceability, energy, tempo, etc.), and popularity.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Kaggle API Integration**:
     - Kaggle API is used to download the dataset.
     - Python libraries `kagglehub` and `requests` are employed for automation.
     ```python
     import kagglehub
     dataset_path = kagglehub.dataset_download("spotify-dataset")
     ```
  2. **Upload to Blob Storage via Airflow**:
     - Apache Airflow orchestrates the automation due to its strengths in workflow automation, such as scheduling, monitoring, and managing complex data pipelines. It was specifically chosen for its compatibility with WSL for Windows users, allowing seamless execution in a Windows environment, and its ease of integration with Azure services for handling large-scale data workflows.
     - The raw dataset is uploaded to an Azure Blob Storage container named `rawdata`. This step ensures centralized and scalable storage for subsequent processing.

### **2. Data Storage in Azure Blob**

- **Azure Blob Storage**:
  - Acts as the central repository for raw and processed data.
  - Containers:
    - `rawdata`: Stores the raw Kaggle dataset.
    - `cleandata`: Stores the cleansed and transformed data.
  - Airflow triggers scripts to process the dataset and write cleansed data back to the `cleandata` container.

---

### **3. Data Transformation**

- **Platform**: Azure Databricks
- **Objective**: Cleanse and transform raw data by addressing missing values, normalizing features (e.g., tempo, loudness), and creating new interaction features such as `energy_tempo`. Write the processed data back to Blob Storage in Delta format for efficient querying and analysis.

#### **Steps**:

1. **Data Processing in Databricks**:
   - Raw data is loaded into a Databricks notebook.
   - Transformation steps include:
     - Handling missing values.
     - Normalizing numerical features (e.g., tempo, loudness).
     - Creating interaction features (e.g., energy \* tempo).
     ```python
     df["energy_tempo"] = df["energy"] * df["tempo"]
     ```
2. **Output**:
   - Transformed data is saved in **Delta format** in the `cleandata` container on Azure Blob Storage.
   ```python
   df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save(output_path)
   ```

### **4. Data Warehousing in Synapse Analytics**

- **Platform**: Azure Synapse Analytics
- **Objective**: Store cleansed data in a data warehouse for advanced analytics and visualization.

#### **Steps**:

1. **Synapse Workspace Setup**:

   - A Synapse SQL pool is configured to serve as the data warehouse.
   - The Delta files from Blob Storage are ingested into Synapse using external tables and pipelines.

2. **Data Model**:

   - Tables:
     - **Staging Table**: Holds the cleansed data.
     - **Fact Table**: Tracks metrics like popularity.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE staging_tracks AS
   SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(
     BULK 'https://shushilgstorage.blob.core.windows.net/cleandata/*.delta',
     FORMAT = 'DELTA'
   )
   ```

3. **Spark Notebooks for Analytics**:

   - Synapse Spark pools are used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
   - Analytical queries identify trends in track popularity based on attributes like region, tempo, and valence.

### **5. Business Intelligence with Power BI**

- **Platform**: Power BI
- **Objective**: Provide business insights from Synapse data.

#### **Steps**:

1. **Data Connectivity**:
   - Connect Power BI to the Synapse SQL pool via a DirectQuery connection.
2. **Dashboards**:
   - **Popularity Trends**: Visualize how popularity varies by region and time.
   - **Feature Correlation**: Highlight the influence of audio features on track popularity.

---

### **6. Machine Learning with Azure ML**

- **Platform**: Azure ML
- **Objective**: Build and deploy a predictive model for track popularity.

#### **Steps**:

1. **Data Preparation**:

   - The cleansed data is pulled from Synapse staging tables into an Azure ML Notebook.
   - Features include `energy`, `tempo`, `valence`, and engineered features like `energy_tempo`.

2. **Model Building**:

   - Train a `RandomForestRegressor` model:
     ```python
     from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
     model = RandomForestRegressor()
     model.fit(X_train, y_train)
     ```
   - Evaluate the model using RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

3. **Deployment**:

   - Register the model in Azure ML for deployment.

   ```python
   from azureml.core.model import Model
   model = Model.register(workspace=ws, model_path="outputs/model.pkl", model_name="spotify_popularity_model")
   ```
